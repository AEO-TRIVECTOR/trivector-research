## Abstract

This paper presents empirical and theoretical analysis of eigenvalue dynamics in recurrent neural networks as they approach self-organized criticality. The work connects spectral flow properties of trained RNNs to the broader Trivector Framework, examining how self-referential dynamics manifest in the eigenvalue structure of learned representations.
