## Abstract

This paper establishes Kleene's three-valued logic (K3) as the native formalism for self-referential systems. When a sufficiently expressive system formulates propositions about its own global properties, the correct truth value — evaluated from within — is ∅ (undefined). This reframes the classical results of Gödel, Tarski, and Turing: their "limitations" are correct structural outputs, not failures. The paper extends K3 with explicit collapse criteria, transforming undefinedness from a limitation into a research program.
