## Abstract

We present TensorENCHC (Extended Noncommutative Cohesive Higher Categories), a unified mathematical framework for self-referential systems. The Omega constant W(1) ≈ 0.567143 emerges not as an assumption but as an **optimality condition**: systems minimizing self-encoding mismatch necessarily satisfy λ₁ = μ = W(1). This variational derivation resolves previous concerns about circularity in the axiom structure.

The framework yields four main contributions: (1) a variational principle with three parallel interpretations (information-theoretic, geometric, thermodynamic); (2) a universal characterization theorem across four mathematical domains; (3) rigorous derivations of Tononi's five IIT axioms from spectral self-reference; and (4) a sheaf-theoretic consistency proof demonstrating global coherence across local models.
