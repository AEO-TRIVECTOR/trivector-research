## Description

This compendium consolidates the complete theoretical framework for self-referential systems developed through the α⊗ε⊗ω collaboration (August 2025 – January 2026). It integrates three interlocking formalisms:

1. **TensorENCHC** — The variational foundation showing that systems minimizing self-encoding mismatch necessarily satisfy λ₁ = μ = W(1) ≈ 0.567143
2. **K3 Logic** — Three-valued logic as the native formalism for self-reference, where Undefined (∅) is a structural feature
3. **Trivector Framework** — Unifying constants, derivations, and falsifiable predictions across networks, fractals, IIT, and quantum systems
