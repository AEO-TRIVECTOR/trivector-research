## Abstract

This paper establishes that self-referential semigroups satisfying spectral self-consistency conditions have principal eigenvalue λ₁ = W(1) ≈ 0.567143, where W is the Lambert W function. The result provides the foundational characterization theorem of the Trivector Framework, showing that the Omega constant is the unique fixed point of self-encoding dynamics in dissipative systems.
